TMZ has reported that Jonathan Koppenhaver also known as War Machine, the jackass convicted of assaulting his ex-girlfriend Christy Mack and breaking her nose, teeth, ribs, face and liver. While serving a life sentence and maybe able to get out after about 30+ years, War Machine is engaged to 30-year-old Ashley Farrington, that the two were pen pals since 2017. At least she is safe for the next 30+ years and the man formerly known as War Machine is now Wedding Machine!
